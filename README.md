# Conway's Game of Life with Raylib üå±üéÆ
![Conways Simulation Running](cover.png)

This project implements **Conway's Game of Life** using **C++** and the **Raylib** library. The simulation provides an interactive experience where players can toggle cells, control the simulation speed, and generate random states or reset the grid.

## Project Overview üéØ

The **Game of Life** is a cellular automaton created by John Conway. It simulates the evolution of a 2D grid of cells, where each cell is either alive or dead. The grid evolves over discrete time steps according to a set of simple rules based on the states of neighboring cells.

## Project Components ‚öôÔ∏è

1. **Game Logic (`main.cpp`)**: Contains the primary game logic, including handling user input, managing the simulation state, and rendering the grid and cells.

2. **Simulation Class**:
   - **Simulation**: Manages the state of the grid, updating the cells, and rendering the grid.
   - Handles functions like toggling individual cells, starting, stopping, randomizing, and clearing the grid.

3. **Graphics**: The game features simple 2D graphics using the **Raylib** library.

## Features üåü

- **Interactive Cell Toggling**: Click on cells with the mouse to toggle their state between alive and dead.
- **Simulation Control**: 
  - Press **Enter** to start the simulation.
  - Press **Space** to stop the simulation.
- **Speed Control**: 
  - Increase the simulation speed by pressing **F**.
  - Decrease the simulation speed by pressing **S**.
- **Random Grid Generation**: Press **R** to generate a random grid state.
- **Clear the Grid**: Press **C** to clear the grid and reset all cells.
- **Real-time Simulation**: The grid evolves in real-time, based on the Game of Life rules.

## Usage üßë‚Äçüíª

1. **Download and Install Dependencies**:
    - You need to install **Raylib** and set up your C++ development environment.

2. **Run the Simulation**:
    - Compile the game using a suitable C++ compiler with Raylib linked.

3. **Interact with the Simulation**:
    - **Click**: Toggle the state of individual cells.
    - **Enter**: Start the simulation.
    - **Space**: Stop the simulation.
    - **F/S**: Increase or decrease the simulation speed.
    - **R**: Generate a random starting state.
    - **C**: Clear the grid.

4. **Game Objective**:
    - Observe how cells evolve over time following Conway's Game of Life rules, or interactively design your own patterns!

## Dependencies üì¶

- **Raylib**: A simple and easy-to-use library for videogame programming.
- **C++ Compiler**: You will need a C++ compiler like g++, MSVC, or clang.
  
## Installation and Running the Game üõ†Ô∏è
